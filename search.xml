        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>It</strong> was in late 2019 that I was told I had to learn the knowledge of front end due to the requirements of our project. I’ve never been involved in this area before nor others in our group. So I began to study about it by myself. However, a few days later, I was moved to another group. It became unnecessary to go on. But I found that front end was really interesting and kept to explore it at my leisure even if my pace was slow.</p><p><strong>Yesterday</strong> I tried to create this page, accually the very first doc I have read for study front end told me to publish a page on GitHub like this. But at that time I couldn’t figure it out. What a good day! I eventually acquired my own page. I wrote my feelings and hoped I can stay enthusiastic. </p>]]></content>
